Typically I dread hiring freelancers for small odds and ends on larger scale projects because they typically end up costing me more time than they save me but not only did he get an understanding of what I was needing done in a quick fashion he also didn't push back when I informed him that it would have be developed a certain way. Its nice to work with a professional that can build our project to the spec required. 5 STARS!",
